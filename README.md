# Note-Taker-
Application that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

## Description

The Note Taker can be used to create notes/tasks for your self. In order to use, you will click the body of the page and add a title for your note along with the content then click save and it will appear on the left column. 

One thing to note, I setup the backend for this application, which allows for the functionality of the notes to work and get saved to the server. The frontend code was provided. 

Some challenges I faced were adding too many different types of code and not knowing which direction to take. And also connecting my backend to the frontend. The logic was somewhat confusing, but with practice, attending office hours , and working with the tutor I was able to grasp a betteer understanding of the various concepts it takes to create a server for an already developed front end. I also am learning about being able to see the live changes in the browser and in the termial I thought that was pretty cool, now that I am starting to comprehend that functionality.
